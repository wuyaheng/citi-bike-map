## Description
The NYC Citi Bike Availability Map is a dashboard that displays all Citi bike stations and their bike availability on a real-time basis. The left side of the dashboard provides a holistic view of the total available classic Citi bikes and electric bikes. The accompanying bar chart shows the number of stations that have empty, low, and normal status. The station has a low status if it has less than 5 bikes and a normal status if it has 5 or more bikes. On the right side, users can find the real-time availability of bikes at each station by hovering over the marker. By default, normal, low, and empty stations will all be displayed on the map, but users can choose to only display the stations that have bikes available.
